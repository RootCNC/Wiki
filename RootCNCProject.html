<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Root CNC&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>The Root CNC family is an evolution of small and large Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) routers, with an emphasis on 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf hardware components that can be constructed in any home garage. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Root 2 CNC</strong>: &nbsp;Recommended build size between xx - xx and yy - yy. &nbsp;Belt driven CNC with wooden base-board and side panels. &nbsp;Replaced by Root 3 CNC.</p>
<p><strong>Root 3 CNC:</strong> &nbsp;Recommended build size between xx- xx and yy - yy. &nbsp;Belt drive CNC with wooden base-board and side panels. &nbsp;Nema 23 stepper motors.</p>
<p><strong>Root 3 Lite:</strong> &nbsp;Compact belt-driven version of Root 3 with smaller (Nema 17) stepper motors. &nbsp;Flexible, convenient and powerful option where large cutting areas not required. &nbsp;Further information available at the <a href="https://github.com/RootCNC/Root-3-Lite-CNC">Root 3 Lite Github repository</a> and <a href="https://rootcnc.com/">website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Root 4 CNC:</strong> &nbsp;Recommended build size between xx- xx and yy - yy. &nbsp;Heavy duty, ballscrew driven X, Y and Z axes, with Nema 23 stepper motors. &nbsp;Designed to use AC Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) driven AC spindle, but flexible enough to use other spindle/router options. &nbsp;Reference material available at the <a href="https://github.com/RootCNC/Root-4-CNC">Root 4 CNC Github repository</a> and <a href="https://rootcnc.com/root-4/">website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Root 4 Lite:</strong> &nbsp; Compact version of Root 4 with smaller (Nema 17) stepper motors. &nbsp;Convenience of a smaller, lighter footprint, lower cost high performance CNC capable of working wood, plastics and light metals. &nbsp;Recommended build size <a href="https://github.com/RootCNC/Root_4_Lite/blob/main/Working%20Area.xlsx">working area</a> between 174x230mm to 974x980mm. &nbsp;Reference material available at the <a href="https://github.com/RootCNC/Root_4_Lite">Root 4 Lite Github repository</a> and <a href="https://rootcnc.com/root-4-lite/">website</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Root Controller: &nbsp;</strong>Flexible ESP32 GRBL (FluidNC) isolated motion controller designed to provide ultimate flexibility across a wide range of hardware and operating conditions. &nbsp;Perfectly suited for larger CNC machines, but not limited to Root CNC. &nbsp;Further information available at the <a href="https://github.com/RootCNC/Root-Controller-ISO">Root Controller ISO Github</a>.</p>
