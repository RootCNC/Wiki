I started this project to enable me to do another project which required sheet wood to be machined, (another 3D printer which I have been wanting to do for a while). without the large cost of out sourcing the tasks to a company. So I created this CNC named Root 2 to open up a endless amount of possibilities.
Why make it open source? Since getting involved with 3D printing and the whole open source community, it has taught me many things and open doors which might not have been open without the added experience the community has given me. So I thought what a great way to put something small back into very thing what got me hooked in the magical world of CNC machine - the open source community.
If you make one or remix it, I would love to see it! post some photos and show it off! =]
